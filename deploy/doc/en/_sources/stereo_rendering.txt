Stereo rendering
****************

The stereoscopic rendering mode is intended for viewing the content
using special glasses. It is activated by an application via API.

Blend4Web supports two techniques of the stereo image rendering -
anagliph image and the HMD (head-mounted display).

HMD is an experimental feature, for now it works only with the "Eye"
type cameras.


Activation
==========

To use HMD stereo rendering, you need to install Oculus's runtime
utility. Windows and MacOS versions can be found on the Oculus web
site in binary format, while Linux version should be compiled from the
source code.

For now, the HMD is supported by the Chromium experimental builds and
in the Firefox nightly builds.

the settings, in the third column from the right, as shown on the

For stereo rendering to work correctly, switching to the full screen
mode is recommended.
