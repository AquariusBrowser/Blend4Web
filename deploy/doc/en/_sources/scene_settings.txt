All the parameters that define the look and behavior of the whole
scene (and not just a single object) are found on the three panels:
the "Render" panel, the "Scene" panel and the "World" panel.


The Render panel.
=================

[image]

All scene parameters that concern the image rendering are found on
this panel.


Reflections and Refractions

   Set to "AUTO" by default.

*Quality*
   Quality settings for the reflection effect. Can be set to "HIGH"
   (highest reflection quality), "MEDIUM" (medium quality) or to "LOW"
   (lowest quality). Set to "MEDIUM" by default.

*End Frame*
   The last frame of the timeline. Set to 250 by default.

*Frame Rate*
   Number of the frames per second. Set to 24 by default. This
   parameter only affect the animation playback speed (not the scene
   itself).


The Scene panel
===============

[image]

The settings that concern scene behavior, including audio, physics and
animation settings, are found on this panel.


Scene
-----

Scene settings.

[image]

*Camera*
   A camera that is used to render the scene.


Units
-----

Sets the measurement units used in the scene.

[image]


Audio
-----

Audio settings. Enabled by default.

[image]

*Dynamic Compressor*
   Compress audio signal's dynamic range. This feature can be used to
   make the sound more rich and even. Disabled by default.

*Treshold*
   If the amplitude of the audio signal exceeds the value specified by
   this parameter, the compressor will reduce its level. Set to -24 dB
   by default.

*Knee*
   The interval below the threshold where the responce curve switches
   to the decreasing mode. Set to 30 by default.

*Ratio*
   Amount of gain reduction. Set to 12 by default.

*Attack*
   Time (in seconds) that takes the compressor to reduce gain by 10
   dB. Set to 0.003 by default.

*Release*
   Time (in seconds) that takes the compressor to increase gain by 10
   dB. Set to 0.25 by defaault.


Logic Editor
------------

Settings for the use of the logic node trees (created in the logic
editor) in the scene. Disabled by default.

[image]

*Active Node Tree*
   Node tree that is used in the scene's playback.


NLA
---

Non-Linear Animation playback settings. Disabled by default.

[image]

*Cyclic NLA*
   If this parameter is enabled, NLA animation will be repeated after
   it is finished.


Meta Tags
---------

Application's meta tags.

[image]

*Title*
   The title of the application.

*Description*
   The description of the application. Can be a simple text or a link
   to a text file (if the "Description Source" parameter is set to the
   "File" value).

*Description Source*
   The source of the application's description. The description can be
   loaded from a file or specified directly in the "Description"
   field. This parameter can have one of the two values, "Text" and
   "File", and it is set to "Text" by default.


Physics
-------

Physics settings.

[image]

*Enable Physics*
   Allow using physics in the application. Enabled by default.


Batching
--------

The size of the grid used to batch the object with the same materials
can be specified here. This parameter can be used for optimization
purposes.

[image]

*Batch Grid Size*
   The size of the grid in meters. Set to zero by default (in such
   case, the grid isn't used).


Objects Selection
-----------------

Object selection settings. Objects can be selected both with the API
function pick_object() and with the logic nodes.

Note: In the scene viewer, selection is enabled by default. You can
  turn it off in the "Tools & Debug" panel.

[image]

*Enable*
   The parameter that defines if the object can or can't be selected.
   It can have "ON", "OFF" or "AUTO" value. Set to "AUTO" by default.


Anchors
-------

   The mist effect starts to appear at this distance from the camera.
   Set to 5 by default.

*Height*
   This parameter specifies how fast mist intensity decreases as the
   the camera's altitude increases. Set to 0 by default.

*Fall out*
   This parameter specifies the rule, according to which the density
