Problems Upon Startup
=====================

*1. The "Browser could not initialize WebGL" message is shown*.

Follow the instructions listed in the WebGL Failed to Init section.

*2. The user interface or background is shown but the default scene is
not rendered. At the same time the* http://get.webgl.org/ *site and
other WebGL applications are working correctly.*

   Possible causes:

   * A local web server is not used or the browser is not set up for
     loading local resources. See the Loading Local Resources section.

   * The engine tries to load resource files which were moved or
     deleted.

   * You are using the old versions of video drivers.

   * You are using open source drivers which do not fully support
     WebGL.

        For Linux users - due to incomplete OpenGL implementation in
        open source drivers at the moment it is recommended to use
        current versions of proprietary drivers for Nvidia and AMD
        video cards.

   * You are using an outdated operating system, such as Windows XP.


WebGL Failed to Init
====================

The http://get.webgl.org/ page tells about problems when viewing it in
recent Chrome or Firefox. What can I do?

1. Install the latest updates for your system (for MS Windows see
   the guide). In case of MS Windows install the latest DirectX
   runtime. Reboot.

2. It is recommended to timely update video card drivers. To detect
   your video card and its vendor please type **about:gpu** (or
   **chrome://gpu**) to the address bar of Chrome browser...

or Firefox...

For Windows, you can run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool called
**dxdiag**.

Download the drivers from the corresponding support center (for
example Intel, Nvidia, AMD/ATI). Reboot the system after the drivers
are installed.

3. If the measures described above did not help to initialize
   rendering (or there is no possibility to update the system) try to
   change the browser settings.

*For Chrome*:

Enter **about:flags** (or **chrome://flags**) into the browser's
address bar, click "Enable" under the "Override software rendering
list" option and restart the browser.

*For Firefox*:

Enter **about:config** into the browser's address bar, search for the
"webgl.force-enabled" parameter and double-click on it to switch from
"false" to "true".

Known Issues
============

* Problems with updating of the add-on.

     Itâ€™s strongly adviced to restart Blender after installing a newer
     version of Addon/SDK.

* NVIDIA 331 driver in Linux can cause WebGL errors.

* Changed texture filtering on some platforms.

     An incorrect texture filtering was disabled on iPad and Internet
     Explorer for materials with Alpha Clip type of transparency.

* Some devices with Mail GPU require manual WebGL activation in
  browser settings.

* For the local developement server to work on Apple OS X and
  Blender 2.76, you may need to install *Python 3.4
  <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/>*. This is due
  to a bug in Blender https://developer.blender.org/T46623. This bug
  has been fixed in Blender 2.76b, so updating it is advised.

* Skeletal animation may work incorrectly while using Nouveau
  drivers.

* Transparent textures may not render correctly in the IE11 and
  Microsoft Edge web browsers and on iPad.

     The problem is relevant for the transparent materials. Image
     artifacts are visible in the areas where alpha channel value is
     close or equal to zero. To fix this issue, it is recommended to
     increase the value of the alpha channel until artifact are no
     longer visible (increasing it by value from 0.01 to 0.05 should
     be enough in the most cases).
