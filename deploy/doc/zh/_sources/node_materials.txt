Shader nodes extend significantly the potential of Blender’s standard
materials by means of presenting shading as a batch of basic
transformations.

Standard Nodes
==============

Blend4Web supports all standard Blender nodes, but some of them do not
work fast enough and are not recommended to use in real time
applications. Creating very complex materials, especially using large
numbers of "Geometry" and "Texture" nodes, is also not recommended.

Cycles nodes are only partially supported: in most cases they will not
work in Blend4Web the same way they do in Blender. They also might not
work at all or even cause material in which they are used to work
incorrectly. However, using Cycles nodes will not cause instabilities
in the application workflow.




Engine Specific Nodes
=====================

Engine-specific nodes extend functionality of the standard nodes to
support extra features. These nodes are created as node groups ("Node
Groups" or "Node Tree") with specially determined names and input
formats. For convenience, all special nodes are added to a blend file
when it is opened.

Replace (B4W_REPLACE)
---------------------

The node replaces the inputs depending on the working environment
(i.e. Blender viewport or Blend4Web). When working in Blender the
"Color1" input is connected to the "Color" output and the "Color2"
input is ignored. On the contrary when working in the engine the
inputs are interchanged (the "Color1" one is ignored and the "Color2"
one is connected to the output). The node is intended to display one
node structure in the viewport and another - in the engine.

[图片]

As a rule it is used for normal mapping. Blender’s node materials do
not support a tangent space of coordinates. Therefore the only
possible method to display normal maps in the viewport correctly is
their usage inside the "Material" nodes.


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Color1*
   Node setup that will be visible in the Blender viewport.

*Color2*
   Node setup that will be visible in the Blend4Web engine.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Color*
   Should be connected to the "Color" socket of the "Material" or
   "Extended Material" node.


Clamp (B4W_CLAMP)
-----------------

The node limits the output value. As a result all the output vector
components take values from 0 to 1 inclusive.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Image*
   Incident vector.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Image*
   Clamped vector.


Time (B4W_TIME)
---------------

Provides the timeline counting from the engine start (in seconds). Can
be used for animating any parameters in node materials, such as UV
coordinates, mixing factors, transparency etc.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Value*
   Time (in seconds) elapsed from the engine startup.

参见: Animation of Value and RGB Nodes


Vector View (B4W_VECTOR_VIEW)
-----------------------------

The node transforms a vector into the camera’s space of coordinates.
Transformation is necessary because the engine defines most of vectors
in the world space of coordinates. If normal vector is being
transformed by this node it should be used only for effects and not
for connecting to the output of the "Material" or "Extended Material"
nodes.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Vector*
   Vector coordinates in the world-space.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Vector*
   Vector coordinates in the camera-space.


Parallax (B4W_PARALLAX)
-----------------------

The node implements the texture coordinates offset using a height map.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*UV*
   Source texture coordinates.

*Height Map*
   RGBA texture with a height map packed into the alpha channel.

*Scale*
   Texture coordinates offset factor.

*Steps*
   The number of steps for iterative generation of texture coordinates
   offset. The bigger this value is the better is the final quality.

*Lod Distance*
   Maximum distance from camera at which the effect is observed.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*UV*
   Resulting texture coordinates which are used as input for the
   texture nodes.


Translucency (B4W_TRANSLUCENCY)
-------------------------------

The node implements a translucency effect (with respect to light
sources only) for thin objects such as cloth, leaves, paper etc. The
effect consists of two parts: 1) brightening of the object side which
is opposite to the light source and 2) appearance of a light spot
right in the light source place.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Color*
   One-channel texture which defines material heterogeneity - the
   white color denotes maximum translucency effect while the black
   color denotes its absence. White color is used by default.

*Backside Factor*
   Material color correction coefficient for the side which is
   opposite to the light source. It describes the color richness
   effect for the translucent areas.

   * *Backside Factor < 1* - brightening

   * *Backside Factor = 1* - no correction

   * *Backside Factor > 1* - darkening

   The default value is 1.

*Spot Hardness*
   Light spot blurring factor. The bigger this value is the smaller is
   the spot and the sharper are the spot edges. The default value is
   1000.

*Spot Intensity*
   Light spot intesity. The bigger this value is the brighter is the
   light spot. The default value is 1.

*Spot Diffuse Factor*
   Material diffuse color influence on the light spot color.

   * *Spot Diffuse Factor = 0* - the light spot has the diffuse
     color

   * *Spot Diffuse Factor = 1* - the light spot color is white

   The default value is 1.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Translucency*
   The output should be connected to the "Translucency" input of the
   "Extended Material" node.

注解: This node can work incorrectly, if the mesh normals were
  edited.


Refraction (B4W_REFRACTION)
---------------------------

Applies refraction effect to an object. This effect works only in the
Blend4Web engine and not in the Blender’s viewport.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Normal*
   Normal map for adding perturbations.

*Refraction Bump*
   Value of perturbation strength.

   The default value is 0.001.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Color*
   Rendered texture behind object with perturbations.

注解: It’s neccessary to set the "Refractions" option from the
  "Render > Reflections and Refractions" panel to value "AUTO" or
  "ON". The object’s transparency type must be set to "Alpha Blend".

参见: Transparency


Levels of Quality (B4W_LEVELS_OF_QUALITY)
-----------------------------------------

Sets up the output color based on the current image quality settings.
Can be used to, for example, replace complex material with more simple
one if the application is running on a mobile device.

[图片]

参见: Quality Profiles


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*HIGH*
   Node links this parameter to "Color" parameter in case of high and
   maximum quality usage.

*LOW*
   Node links this parameter to "Color" parameter in case of low
   quality usage.

*Fac*
   This value specifies what quality setting ("HIGH" or "LOW") will be
   visible in the Blender viewport. Can change from 0 to 1. If the
   value is lower than 0.5, the "HIGH" setting will be visible, if it
   is 0.5 or higher, the "LOW" setting will be visible.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Color*
   Output color.


Smoothstep (B4W_SMOOTHSTEP)
---------------------------

Performs smooth interpolation between two input values based on first
value.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Value*
   Value which determines interpolation smoothness.

*Edge0*
   First interpolation value.

*Edge1*
   Second interpolation value.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Value*
   Interpolated value.

注解: For the correct interpolation input "Value" had to be between
  "Edge0" and "Edge1".


Glow Output (B4W_GLOW_OUTPUT)
-----------------------------

Applies the Glow effect to the node material. Besides the
*B4W_GLOW_OUTPUT* node, the node material should have the *Output*
node.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Glow Color*
   Glow color.

*Factor*
   Glow ratio. *Factor* \in [0, 1].

   * *Factor = 0* - no glow.

   * *Factor* \in (0, 1] - there is a glow, colored with *Glow
     Color*.

注解: The "Transparency->Type" parameters of the material don’t
  affect behavior of the glow effect. It always corresponds to the
  transparent material (not the "Alpha Clip" type).


Reflect (B4W_REFLECT)
---------------------

Calculates the reflection direction for an incident vector and a
normal vector. Can be used to apply a cubemap to an object.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Vector*
   Incident vector. Should be connected to the "View" socket of the
   "Geometry" node.

*Vector*
   Normal vector. Should be normalized in order to achieve the desired
   result. Should be connected to the "Normal" socket of the
   "Geometry" node.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Vector*
   Reflected vector. Should be connected to the "Vector" socket of the
   "Texture" node that contains the cubemap.


Linear to SRGB and SRGB to Linear (Deprecated)
----------------------------------------------

Converts colors from linear space to sRGB or vice versa. This function
has been declared deprecated sicne the version 15.04. In the newer
versions, the native "Gamma" node with the value of 2.200 should be
used to convert color from sRGB to linear space, and the same node
with the value of 0.455 to convert color from linear space to sRGB.
